      <h2> Level 0 - Poor </h2>
      <p> Below Average, being poses no threat to society even if they so wanted to. </p>
      <br><h2> Level 1 - Average </h2>
      <p> Being of standard capabilities, strength, speed, intelligence, etc. They are on par with their community. The threat level is insignificant. </p>
      <br><h2> Level 2 - Village </h2>
      <p>
        A village under our classifications ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand beings. An individual with powers that can rival the best of a village  
        class start to pose a danger on MetasUnmasked’s scale based on perceived threat level.
      </p>
      <br><h2> Level 3 - Town </h2>
      <p>
        A town is defined as a settlement containing between 5,000 and 50,000 individuals. Viewer discretion is advised when coming into contact with these beings as they possess powers at the top tier of a population of town-size.
      </p>
      <br><h2> Level 4 - City </h2>
      <p>
        A city is classified as a settlement with between 50,000 and 8,000,000 beings. Individuals that contain power levels in this stream are the first to exceed the current detainment facilities of the MetasUnmasked Task Force. 
      </p>
      <br><h2> Level 5 - Nation </h2>
      <p>
        Nations range from 8,000,000 to 1,500,000,000 inhabitants. Beings on this scale can rival the best of individuals within this population. Earth’s current police and military forces are incapable of handling threats at this level, even if they are afraid to admit it.
      </p>
      <br><h2> Level 6 - Planet </h2>
      <p>
        These populations are defined to contain 5,000,000,000 to 25,000,000,000 inhabitants. Planet-level threats range from being the most dangerous individuals in a planet’s history to having the capabilities to destroy an entire planet.
      </p>
      <br><h2> Level 7 - Star System </h2>
      <p>
        At this range, population size is no longer calculated. Now it is a matter of pure mass and energy. Beings at this power index can dominate or destroy an entire star system. These self-contained habitats contain five to two hundred planets and at least one star.
      </p>
      <br><h2> Level 8 - Galaxy </h2>
      <p>
        A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. A being on this level could have abilities such as speeds approaching light-speed or destructive forces capable of obliterating a star system with the blink of an eye.
      </p>
      <br><h2> Level 9 - Universe </h2>
      <p>
        Run! If you come in contact with these beings you are already dead.
