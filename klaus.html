		<h1>BackStory</h1> <hr/>
		<p>
			Former Russian and proud Soviet, Klaus was forced to defect after his parents sought a better life for him (despite countless protests) and themselves in America. There, his parents used their extensive wealth to drown Klaus in anything he possibly needed or wanted, from video games to new shoes.<br><br>

			However, unlike his two sisters, who became prominent real estate moguls in their own right, Klaus had a strong passion for the sciences, particularly computer engineering. When Klaus was no more than the age of twelve, he had already hacked into the computer systems of his school to lower the grades of his enemies. He would have also increased his own scores if they were not already perfect marks.<br><br>

			After graduating from MIT with a Ph.D. in computer engineering, Klaus sought an extensive career at New World Technologies in the networking and cyber security department. There, he is able to hack computer systems and create deadly viruses used in technological warfare legally (mostly).

		<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
		<p>
			Klaus is a staff member at New World Technologies, working as a Level 4 Engineer, otherwise known as a Senior Spec. On the side, he is an unofficial member of the Hacking Group known infamously as <i>Hack It Up</i>.
