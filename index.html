		<h1> Welcome True Believers...</h1>

			to the largest super-being database on the Eastern seaboard. Now to be fair, there are only two documented instances of supes, and both of these instances don’t have powers per se. However, here at SuperDbs, we classify supes as any beings capable of posing a physical threat to the average population at large. See <span><a href="powerIndex.html">Power-Index</a></span> for further details. No other database has even attempted to monitor these beings, not the FBI, the CIA, or the DOJ—not one. But it always starts at one. Mark my words, this database will be growing by the day as technology progresses and new super-powered beings make themselves known to society.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first case documented is that of a naive yet quite virtuous time traveler by the name of Michael Preston from Massachusetts. If you would like to learn more about this hero, please read the following synopsis:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Blasting a Nazi Jet, the first of its kind, right out of the sky. Too lame, got it. Saving JFK from a fatal sniper, knocking him out of the way at the last second. Still not interesting enough, huh? How about preventing the nine-eleven attacks from ever happening, saving 3000 innocent lives in the process. All of this is made possible by a device capable of transporting an individual back to the exact time and location in which a photo was taken. With his time machine, American prodigy Michael Preston is able to reshape history to his will, preserving the lives of millions who were so woefully slain.
			<br><br>
			However, there is one problem. As in the space race in the sixties, the Russians have developed a quantum device of their own, sending their own champion to reform history to how they see fit. The duo’s clashing theories about how things should be and not how things are between Michael and his Russian foe lead to some fascinating conflicts throughout time. And in some cases, these feuds force Michael to question not whether he can change the past but if he is doing the right thing and whether his actions are that of a kind-hearted man and not a fame-hungry monster.
