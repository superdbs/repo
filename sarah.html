		<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
		<p>
			What if you could live forever? What would you do with your life, and how would you behave differently if your days were not numbered. That was Sarah—something she had on her mind since she was a small child. She always felt life, whether human or that of an insect, was too delicate, too fractional, and needed to be preserved. From then on began her interest in the science of aging. She sought to delay it or rather halt it. And so began her studies in the fields of both physics and biologic-based cryogenics. <br><br>

			After attending Boston College, she made way in developing a temporary drug that increased the average lifespan of a short-lived bacterium from ten days to two months.<br><br>

			After receiving her Ph.D. in biological cryogenics, she went out to get a job at New World Technologies. There she would use her expertise to develop drugs for soldiers capable of expanding their prime/youth, increasing their healing time, and de-aging both their body and their spirit.

		<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>

			Sarah is a new hire and a Senior Associate (level-2) at New World Technologies. She is currently working in the cryogenics biology department. On the side, she also is a member of the hacking group <i>Hack It Up</i>, but unlike others (Klaus), she doesn’t go around bragging about it.
