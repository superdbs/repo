		<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
		<p>
			The year was 1982, and a boy was left alone on the steps of an old, rundown orphanage, ignorant of the cruel, cold twists and turns of the world. That boy was Michael Preston, and he spent so many years of his life hoping and plotting to meet them just to ask them one simple question—why. Why did they leave him to rot alone in a bad neighborhood in the middle of the night long before his first birthday? Michael had spent so many sleepless nights staring at photos of the past, imaging himself standing right along with his deceived relatives. <br> <br>

			Not long after, in 1992, Claire and Patrick Preston came to visit and adopt Michael. They raised him, cherished him, and gave him everything he needed until five years later, when Patrick Preston suddenly dropped dead. This unfortunate event left his family stranded with all his gambling debt. Claire struggled to raise Michael, fighting poverty as a single mother. For his part, Michael aspired to go into a field he hated, law, simply because the money was good. It wasn’t until weeks of arguing did Claire convince Michael to pursue the major he loved, theoretical physics. <br> <br>

			After receiving a Ph.D. in the field, Michael still struggled to find work. This predicament was because his thesis was in an area most would label as pure science fiction—time travel. It wasn’t until a few years later did his best pal from the old orphanage days, Xavier Emeka, landed him a nice shiny desk job at New World Technologies.
