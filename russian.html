		<h1>BackStory</h1><hr/>
		<p>
			Not much is known about this character profile. What is known is he has ties to the Russian empire and possibly the Soviet Union based on the engravings that he bares on his arms—a Soviet star on one side and a sickle on the other.<br><br>

			His motivations also seem unclear; if anything, his journeys throughout time challenging the Americans seem to personify a modern-day version of the 1960s space race. Of course, the main difference being this occurrence deals with time as opposed to space.<br><br>

			Based on our investigations here at MeaHeroWatch, we believe this man to be highly unstable and to be avoided at all costs. Particularly of note is the rather extensive collection of knives he carries on his person. Some of the blades are even energized by some sort of Gamma-induced energy repulsions. 
		</p>
		<h1>Affiliations</h1><hr/>
		<p>
			The Russian’s affiliations are unknown. Based on some analysis by the International Affairs department, we believe he has strong ties to the Kremlin, Russia at large, and possibly the KGB. Whether he has any connections to presidential aspirations is unknown.

			<li><span>Time Machine:</span> This allows an individual to return to the exact time and location in which a picture was taken.</li>
			<li><span>Time Augmenting Device:</span>  This contraption freezes time temporarily for everyone except the wielder.</li>
			<li><span>Homing Beacon:</span>  When activated, this contraption returns a time-traveler to his home time.</li>
			<li>
				<span>Sonic Repulsion System:</span>  This item is a dual-action high-concentration wave generator. The waves are spawned from two gauntlets. When activated large metal spikes protrude from each of the gauntlets. This weapon has only been seen to deter large repulsive blasts and not create any of its own.
			</li>
			<li><span>High-Energy Knives:</span>These weapons are a foot long and 3.5 inches thick at their peak. They closely resemble the blade of a bowie enough, except their edge is high powered by 30 milligrams of pure liquid Zirconium-9 (the densest metal known to Earth). </li>
			<li><span>Flesh Mask</span>  This mask is presumably made out of the flesh of the Russian’s fallen victims. It was stitched together with thick thread and smells of blood. Its main purpose is to conceal the identity of its bearer. </li>
			<li><span>Black Exoskeleton:</span> Although the substance of the suit is unknown, it is believed it is made of high-intensity Kevlar. The material resembles Class-3 Armor produced by New World Technologies with some impact resistant modifications made by their bearer.  </li>
